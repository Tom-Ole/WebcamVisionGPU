# Implementation of Computer Vision / Image Processing Effects
This repository contains implementations of various computer vision and image processing effects. 
The goal is to create simple, efficient algorithms that can be run in real-time on Webcam streams.

This is a personal project to learn and experiment with different techniques.

A CPU implementation of the first Algorithms are found in my other repository: [WebcamVision](https://github.com/Tom-Ole/WebcamVision)




# Ideas Computer Vision / Image Processing Effects to Implement:
- [x] Grayscale Conversion
- [x] Gaussian Blur
- [x] Median Filter
- [x] Sepia Tone Filter
- [x] Invert Colors
- [x] Sobel Edge Detection
- [x] Canny Edge Detection
- [x] Motion Detection
- [ ] Background Subtraction
- [ ] Optical Flow (Lucas–Kanade or Horn–Schunck Lite)
- [ ] Hough Transform (for Lines or Circles)
- [ ] Corner Detectors (Harris / Shi–Tomasi)
- [ ] Depth from Motion (Structure from Motion Lite)
- [ ] Cartoon / Pencil Drawing Filter
- [ ] Kuwahara / Oil Painting Filter
- [ ] Voronoi Mosaic / Cell Shading
- [ ] Color Object Tracking [Convert to HSV → isolate hue range → centroid of region = object position.]
- [ ] Feature Matching [Detect keypoints (corners) → extract simple descriptors → match across frames.]
- [ ] Optical Flow–Based Stabilization

- [ ] Depth illusion: simulate fake parallax using grayscale brightness as depth
- [ ] Motion trails: accumulate motion over frames to create ghostly afterimages
- [ ] Thermal camera: map brightness → color palette.
